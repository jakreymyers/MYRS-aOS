## Memory

`memory/MEMORY.md` is loaded every session (auto-memory). The knowledge graph extends this with on-demand retrieval — it starts empty and grows organically through session extraction.

**Query proactively** — when the conversation touches a person, project, company, or past decision, search or look up the entity *before* responding by utilizing the memory skill. Ground answers in what the system actually knows. Skip for things already in MEMORY.md, current conversation context, or purely technical tasks.

The cost of a search is ~70ms. The cost of answering without context is high.
